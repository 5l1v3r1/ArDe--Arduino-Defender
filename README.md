ArDe - Arduino Defender 
This project is a simple perimeter alarm controlled via interface (c #)
on serial port.
To turn the alarm off you have to enter the password (default:
123456789) (Yes, it is hard-coded but stay tuned).
You have three attempts, on the third error alarm start.

You can change the COM port in c # source.

You need a laser pointer that pointing the photocell.
